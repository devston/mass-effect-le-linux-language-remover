# Mass Effect Legendary Edition Linux Non-English Language Remover
This is a shell script to remove non english language files from Mass Effect Legendary Edition on Linux.

I mainly put this together to automate the removal of language files I did not need to save some space on my steam deck. This may not be the best way to do things, but it seems to do the job, saving around 40gb from memory. Placing this on github incase its of use to someone else. This targets the steam decks primary storage, so file paths may need to be modified to target SD card paths.

## Disclaimer
Use this at your own risk, this is something I have thrown together and haven't tested extensively so there maybe undesired outcomes.
